# PushPy
A python script that fetches notifications from the nextcloud talk api and pushes them to a gotify server.


### TODO
* Currently the number of conversations must be specified manually. It would be cool to parse the number of conversations from the json data.
* Handle Calls
* Check how it works with group chats
* Find a better name for the program
