# Talkify
A python script that fetches notifications from the nextcloud talk api and pushes them to a gotify server.

### Usage
Just adapt the settings in the settings.py file and start run the script.
A working Nextcloud talk instance and a working gotify setup ist needed.

### TODO
- [x] Currently the number of conversations must be specified manually. It would be cool to parse the number of conversations from the json data.
- [ ] Handle Calls
- [ ] Check how it works with group chats
